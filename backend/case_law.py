"""Case-law metadata: single source of truth for both ingestion
(scripts/chunk_case_law.py) and runtime lookups (backend/api/routes/
sources.py's related_cases field). Per-file metadata isn't reliably
recoverable from body text alone, so it's tracked here explicitly.

`related_articles` drives the Source Explorer's "Landmark judgments"
section: looking up an article reverse-looks-up any case here whose
related_articles includes it.

IMPORTANT: CASE_METADATA must only contain cases that are actually
ingested and indexed in Pinecone. A case listed here with no
corresponding indexed content will silently break the Source Explorer's
reverse-lookup. Add an entry here only after scripts/index.py has confirmed
the case's vectors are live. Cases identified but not yet ingested go in
PENDING_CASE_METADATA below instead.
